            <dt>Blueberry Pierogi</dt> 
            <dd> These, unlike the traditional potatoe pierogis, are filled with blueberries with a doughy outside. This makes them sweeter
                and considered to be more of a desert rather than dinner dish. But in my house it is most defitenly a dinner dish.
                What makes them even better is that these pierogis are homemade using my grandma's recipe.

            <dt>Steak Tacos</dt>
            <dd> These are Steak tacos with just cliantro, onion, and salsa verde the best toppings for a steak taco in my opinion.
                These tacos are from Zaco tacos in chicago, it is by far my favorite place to get tacos from. I also enjoy making tacos at home.

            <dt>Stir-fry</dt>
            <dd> Stir-fry in this case was made by using chicken, you can also use steak. 
                I made this stir-fry using chicken and broclli thne I put it on top of rice. 
                This is one of my favorite meals to make becasue it is so quick and easy and particularly yummy. </dd>
