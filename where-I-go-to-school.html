        <p> The University of Wisconsin-Madison is a public research university in Madison, Wisconsin. 
            The university was founded when the state legislature passed a bill in 1848 to create a university in Madison. 
            I started attending this university in the fall of 2023, where I am studying mechanical engineering.
            I am also a member of Badger Solar Racing where I work directly with the suspension of the vehicle, and a staff member
            at the Design Innovation Lab at Wendt Commons. I am also involved with Saint Paul's Catholic Student Center on 
            campus and play a lot of different intramural sports. I have two intramural sports Championships under my belt. 
            I loven the campus and the city of Madison, if I had to go back and do it all over again I would still choose to attend this university.
            On Wisconsin and GO BADGERS!!
