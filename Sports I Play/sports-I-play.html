            <p> Soccer is by far my favorite sport to play. I have played this sport since I was four years old. 
                I played club all my life all year around, when I wasn't playing club I was training in my backyard. 
                I played for my highschool team, and still play in a little college. Most of my soccer activity in 
                college consists intramurals and pick up back home.
